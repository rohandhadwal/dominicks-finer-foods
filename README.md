# Dominick's Finer Foods Data Warehouse Project

## Project Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a data warehouse for Dominick's Finer Foods (DFF), a former major grocery store chain based in the Chicago area. The data warehouse is built using historical store-level data collected between 1989-1994, providing a comprehensive dataset for analysis of retail operations, pricing strategies, and consumer behavior.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the Dominick's Database, provided by the James M. Kilts Center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. It contains detailed store-level scanner data collected over a period of more than seven years. Key features of the dataset include:

- Customer Count Files: Daily store traffic and sales data across various product departments.
- Store-Specific Demographics: Detailed demographic profiles for each store's trading area based on 1990 U.S. census data.
- UPC Files: Product information including descriptions, sizes, and commodity codes.
- Movement Files: Weekly sales data for each UPC in each store, including price, units sold, and profit margins.

The dataset covers over 25 product categories and includes information from about 100+ stores in the Chicago metropolitan area.
